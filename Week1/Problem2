#Problem 2
#Assume s is a string of lower case characters.
#Write a program that prints the number of times the string 'bob' occurs in s. For example, if s = 'azcbobobegghakl', then your program should print
#Number of times bob occurs is: 2

num = 0
i = 0
while i+3 <= len(s):
    if s[i] == 'b' and s[i+1] == 'o' and s[i+2] == 'b':
        num+=1
        i+=1
    else:
        i+=1
print('Number of times bob occurs is: ' +str(num))
